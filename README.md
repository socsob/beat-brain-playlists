# Beat Brain Playlists

Serves information on current Spotify featured playlists

## Description

Using GitHub Actions, serves and automatically updates the current JSON of featured playlists from the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). Please see [Spotify Developer Terms](https://developer.spotify.com/terms) regarding usage of their API. The information is updated daily and served with GitHub Pages.

## Information

I created this for a particular personal use case. If you have a similar problem to solve using GitHub (a free proxy for an API along with serving the cached data) feel free to see if this can help.
